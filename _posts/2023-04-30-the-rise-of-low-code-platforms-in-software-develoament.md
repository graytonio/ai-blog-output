Low code platforms are gradually becoming a trend in software development, revolutionizing the way businesses automate their processes. These platforms allow developers to build software solutions without the need for intricate coding skills, making it easier for non-technical users to develop applications.

Low code platforms rely on visual modeling techniques and pre-built modules. By utilizing a drag-and-drop system, developers can create workflows, forms, and other functionalities with minimal coding, hence the name `low code.` Because of this, businesses can deliver software solutions faster and cheaper than traditional coding methods.

One of the benefits of low code platforms is that automation becomes possible at an unprecedented scale. With the speed of development increased significantly, businesses can introduce advanced automation features, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotic process automation, with less hassle. This translates to better outcomes, higher efficiency, and lower costs for businesses.

Another key benefit of low code platforms is the democratization of software development. Non-technical users, including business analysts and citizen developers, can now build simple software solutions without the need for extensive technical training. This means that businesses can empower more people to help innovate and enhance processes, improving overall productivity and efficiency.

However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in low code development. A possible downside is the reduction of the developer's control over the code. Low code platforms often require leaving some technical considerations to the platform, which can result in a loss of control and customization opportunities. There is also the risk of creating solutions that cannot scale or integrate with existing legacy systems.

Overall, low code development platforms are an innovative way to help businesses automate their processes, boost productivity, and improve the bottom line. While still nascent, low code development is already an important part of many organizations' software development strategies. As the technology continues to evolve and become more refined, we can expect to see even more efficient and powerful low-code development solutions in the years to come.
