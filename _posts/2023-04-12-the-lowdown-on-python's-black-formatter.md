### What is Black Formatter?

Black Formatter is a Python code formatter that applies various code formatting rules to your Python code. It's opinionated, meaning that it has its own set of rules, and it enforces them strictly. Black Formatter's main goal is to produce consistent and readable Python code that adheres to best practices.

### How does Black Formatter work?

Black Formatter works by analyzing your Python code and applying its formatting rules. It looks for patterns in your code and transforms them into the desired format. Black Formatter can be used as a command-line tool, an IDE plugin, or as part of your development workflow.

### Why use Black Formatter?

Using Black Formatter has several benefits:

- Consistent code: Black Formatter ensures that your code adheres to a consistent style throughout the codebase, even if multiple developers are working on it.
