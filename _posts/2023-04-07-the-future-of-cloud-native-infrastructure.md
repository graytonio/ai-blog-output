The future of cloud native infrastructure is bright, with the increasing adoption of Kubernetes and Docker in many organizations. Cloud native infrastructure has revolutionized how businesses develop, deliver and manage their IT services with agility and efficiency.

Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration platform, has become the de facto standard for managing containerized applications at scale. Docker, another open source platform, provides container building and deployment capabilities, improving developers' experience in building, testing, and running their applications.

The combination of Kubernetes and Docker offers a modern approach to IT infrastructure. The implementation of containers and Kubernetes allows for easier deployment and scaling of applications, thus reducing the complexity of infrastructure management. Through its flexibility, Kubernetes enables businesses to easily move their applications across different cloud environments, avoiding vendor lock-in that occurs when the infrastructure platform is tied to a particular cloud provider.

Cloud native infrastructure provides a cost-effective solution to businesses, which allows for the efficient use of resources while increasing security through its built-in automatic scaling and healing capabilities. Kubernetes, in particular, offers an efficient way of managing infrastructure, through automating the deployment and scaling of applications, thereby minimizing manual operations and increasing efficiency.

As we move into the future, the adoption of Kubernetes and Docker would continue to grow, as businesses continue to rely on cloud native infrastructure to improve their IT services delivery. The continued growth of cloud native infrastructure will allow for better use of resources, reduction in the complexity of managing infrastructure, and better agility in responding to business needs. 

In conclusion, the future of cloud native infrastructure is one that holds great promise for organizations of all sizes. The technological advancements in Kubernetes, Docker, and other container orchestration tools, have made it easier to build, deploy and manage modern IT infrastructure, providing businesses with solutions to meet the current and future demands of their applications.
