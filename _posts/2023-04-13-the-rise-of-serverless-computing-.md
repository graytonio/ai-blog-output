Serverless computing is certainly not new to the cloud computing space. However, with the rapid increase in the demand for digital services, serverless computing is gaining more and more popularity. In this article, we will be discussing the rise of serverless computing and why it is becoming a trend among the developer community.

Traditionally, developers needed to buy or rent servers, storage, and other computing resources to start building any web application. However, with serverless computing, the developer no longer needs to worry about server configuration or scaling. All this is managed by the cloud provider, and developers only pay for the resources they have consumed during the execution of their code.

One of the main advantages of serverless computing is the cost-saving factor. Developers only pay for the processing time and storage they have used to run their function. This makes serverless computing more cost-effective compared to traditional computing models.

Another major advantage of serverless computing is that it can handle a large number of requests at any given time. Since the service provider manages the scaling, developers only need to worry about writing their business logic. This is an ideal feature for businesses that experience sudden spikes in web traffic as it can handle these without any manual intervention.

There are several cloud platforms that offer serverless computing services, including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. These services provide developers with the flexibility and freedom to choose from different programming languages like Python, Node.js, and Java.

To sum up, Serverless computing has revolutionized the way developers build and deploy web applications by eliminating the need to manage servers or infrastructure. It offers a cost-effective and efficient way of computing, making it a perfect match for small scale or mid-scale businesses. As the demand for digital services continues to grow, it can be safely assumed that the trend will continue to grow and weâ€™ll see more businesses move to Serverless computing in the coming years.
